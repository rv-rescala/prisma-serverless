# Overview

Fully serverless web architecture on AWS with Prisma and GraphQL.

CDK version 2 and Amplify are used for deployment and development.

## Features

This template provides GraphQL using AWS serveless services.

- AppSync and API gateway support

- DynamoDB and RDS support

- Prisma support for schema management

- Cognito authentication support

All of codes are written by typescript, and deploy it by AWS CDK and Amplify.

## Tech Stack

- [x] Prisma

Prisma is a performant open-source GraphQL ORM-like layer doing the heavy lifting in your GraphQL server.

[Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/)


- [x] Prisma Appsync

Prisma AppSync is a library that makes it easy to implement GraphQL servers with Prisma.

[Prisma with AWS AppSync](https://github.com/maoosi/prisma-appsync)

- [x] GraphQL

GraphQL is a query language for your API, and a server-side runtime for executing queries by using a type system you define for your data.

- [x] AWS AppSync

AWS AppSync is a managed GraphQL service that makes it easy to develop, secure, and scale GraphQL APIs.

# Architecture

## Access Flow

1. Appsync -> Lambda -> RDS

2. Appsync -> DynamoDB

3. Appsync -> Lambda -> RDS and DynamoDB

# Getting Started

## Local Enviroment

1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

2. Build config

```bash
amplify init
# add api, auth
amplify push
bash ./scripts/build.sh .env.dev
```

3. Test by jest(Prisma Unit Test)

```bash
npx jest -- user-controller.test.ts
```

4. Test by GraphQL Playground

```bash
yarn run dev
```

## Deploy to AWS

1. Deploy to AWS

```bash
# edit cdk.json, change app "name" and "schema" to your name
amplify init
# if you want new env, please run this command:
# amplify env add [env name]
amplify push
bash ./scripts/build.sh [appname] [env] [schema_name] init
```

3. Create schema
```bash
aws lambda list-functions | grep "migration" # Please check function-name you deployed to AWS which include "migration"
aws lambda invoke --function-name <function-name> output.json 
```

4. Insert data to DynamoDB/RDS via GraphQL API

Please open Appsync and run GraphQL on the editor.


x. Delete all resources

```bash
bash ./scripts/destroy.sh .env.dev
```

# Frontend
```bash
cd gatsby
npm install
```

# Customize

## Apprync -> Lambda -> RDS

1. Edit user/prisma/schema.prisma

2. Generate

```bash
bash ./scripts/build.sh [appname] [env] [schema_name] [version]
```

3. Deplpy

```bash
bash ./scripts/deopy.sh [appname] [env] [schema_name] [version]
```

## Appsync -> DynamoDB

1. Edit amplify/schema.graphql

2. Generate

```bash
bash ./scripts/build.sh [appname] [env] [schema_name] [version]
```

3. Deplpy

```bash
bash ./scripts/deopy.sh [appname] [env] [schema_name] [version]
```
